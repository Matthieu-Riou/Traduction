Les avionneurs is querellent on aiming sufficiently high seats while major contracts are at stake 
La dispute is raging between the big manufacturers aviation about aiming sufficiently high seats in the class touriste on the flights long-courriers , opens the way for a confrontation amère at the space of Dubaï hairdresser who took place of month . 
Le conflict is aiming sufficiently high seats proposed on the flights long-courriers passengers of the economic class – who are not always the most courtisés by airlines , but l' area , which is essential to increase the d' efficiency gains in the last devices presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co . 
Cette week , Airbus has called l' aviation industry to establish a standard imposing a size of seat d' at least 18 pouces ( 45,72 cm ) in the economic classes , but his great american rival Boeing declared that it should be to airlines to decide . 
Le dispute broke out , while the avionneurs seek to sell versions even more of their had long-courriers bimoteurs , perhaps a record of contracts in l' matter onboard since that will take place of the 17 in november 21 . 
La way in which the seats are ready to l' back to l' aircraft – in particular , will 9 or ten seats head-on – is essential for the economic efficiency of the segment of the « mini-jumbo » . 
Boeing declare that his « 777X » réaménagé can take economic class 406 people in seats of more than 17 pouces of large , and will be configuré with ten seats by row . 
Airbus indicates that the concurrente version of its A350 goes for 350 people in seats 18 pouces of broad configurés in rangées of 9 . 
Les giants of l' aerospace are trading often the attacks on technical issues in the case in the press . 
Aujourd' , Airbus is directly to the public before the showroom space of Dubaï , where the 777X should take the not on its competitors with more than 100 orders . 
On has been able to realise recently of what might be the beginning d' a new war advertising , with the introduction of the financial ’ a photo showing three people the against the other the restaurant , called « Est-ce that you accepteriez it ? » . 
« Boeing proposes flights long-courriers in seats close that in aircraft turbopropulseurs regional » , has indicated John Leahy , director of trade d' Airbus . 
Comme the dietary change , people grossissent , but the seats in the had n' have not completely changed . 
Entre the beginning of the 1970s , when the jumbo 747 of Boeing has set the journey long-courrier modern , and the turning point of the century , the weight of l' Américain means of 40 to 49 years has increased by 10 % , according to the data of the us department of the Santé . 
Le wave of the size of l' Américain means of XXIe century is 39,7 pouces , according to the statistics health american . 
Airbus declare that his rival s' clinging to a concept of a seat in the 1950s , when the circonférence apparatus of l' at christened « jet so-called » was more closely . 
Airbus adds qu' it has ordered a study , which indicates qu' a further boost to the level of aiming sufficiently high seats improve the quality of the illusion of 53 % . 
Boeing contesting the figures d' Airbus with regard to aiming sufficiently high seats and argue that this n' is not to manufacturers to decide on the way in which the airlines équilibrent the price of notes and equipment . 
Il also said that l' study shows that l' experience in booths is not only by aiming sufficiently high seats . 
« Il s' really are d' to make the flexibility to airlines and allow them to do this qu' they will have to pursue their activities » , said Kent Craver , for the satisfaction passengers among Boeing . 
Elles do not want to qu' they said that they will be profitable d' . 
Elles their company that no one knows better . 
Pour passengers , it is more s' d' have a certain amount of freedom of movement , but for the suppliers , c' is increasingly an issue that may affect their results . 
Derrière the dispute is a race to the orders d' had to estimated d' at least $ 700 Md at market prices in the coming decades , enough to make the balance of american and european exports . 
Comme Reuters l' pointed out for the first time in july , the form of seats is exactly what leads to the battle between the recent devices . 
Airbus and Boeing revendiquent both returns by headquarters in their last models of bimoteurs long-courriers 20 % higher than that of the leader of the market in this sector , the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats . 
Les performance announced by Boeing depend in part of the comparison between the 777X configuré with ten seats by row and a model 777 d' origin configuré in rangées of 9 . 
Le profit in terms of costs rallies is weak compared to l' apparatus configuré with ten seats by row currently service . 
« Boeing made it to be able to caser more seats and make its had more competitive by reports in our products » , said Kevin Keniston , director of Confort Passager among l' european avionneur Airbus . 
D' the other hand , analysts say that the cabin configurées with ten seats by in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers matters for a state d' more intense , which can go hand in hand with charges less expensive . 
« Une largeur of location for 18 pouces would be desired for passengers , but the reality is that , the point of view , the proposal d' Airbus is motivated by the threat of 777 » , said l' an expert in domestic of booths Mary Kirby , fondatrice and rédactrice in leader of Runway Girl Network . 
Airbus and Boeing do not supply of seats , but are proposing a catalogue of suppliers of which airlines must choose . 
Les sellers d' had , which are the round of the world day even with them a metre to verify the configurations competing . 
Tout in ventant to propose equipment adequate profits , all the manufacturers are also aircraft with configurations high-density to airlines low-cost and for travel regional . 
Airbus offers a A350 configuré with ten seats by row but is it not qu' l' has not yet sold . 
Jusqu' to recently Airbus highlighted the need d' greater personnalisation of other languages , providing seats broader side go on some of its aircraft . 
Sans the support of the single other major manufacturer of modern major equipment , experts say qu' it is unlikely that his appeal to l' aviation industry in order to establish a standard of size of the seats succeeds , but qu' it could to forget the wave of sales of 777X .
