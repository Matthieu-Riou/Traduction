Les avionneurs is querellent over the largeur seats , while large commandes are at stake 
La dispute between the big boat aéronautiques about the largeur of the seats in class touriste on the extortion long-courriers , opening the way to confrontation bitter during the salon aéronautique of Dubaï who has place of month . 
Le conflict has focused on the largeur seats proposed on the extortion long-courriers for passengers of the economic class – who are not always the more courtisés by the airlines , but plus space alloué is essential to increase the efficiency gains in the last equipment entertained by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co . 
Cette week , Airbus called the industry aéronautique to establish a standard imposing a size of the seat of at least 18 pouces ( 45,72 cm rise ) in the economic class , but his great american rival Boeing declares that this should be to airlines to decide . 
Le différend erupted , while the avionneurs seek to sell versions of even more great of their airplanes long-courriers bimoteurs , hoping possibly a record of commandes during the évènement who will take place of the 17 in november 21 . 
La way seats remains willing to the back of the plane – in particular , are aura-t-il 9 or ten seats head-on – is essential for the returns of economic segment of the " mini-jumbo . " 
Boeing declares that his " 777X " reconfigured may be welcome in economic class 406 people in of the seats in more than 17 pouces of large , and will be configuré with 10 seats by islam . 
Airbus indicates that the competing version of his A350 secure in economic class grow people in of the seats in 18 pouces of broad configurés in rangées of 9 . 
Les giants of the aéronautique échangent often coups on technical matters by making the advertising in the press professional . 
Aujourd' , Airbus require directly to the public before the salon aéronautique of Dubaï , where the 777X should take precedence over competitors with more than 100 commandes . 
On could realize recently of what might be the beginning of a new air war with the appearance of the financial ’ a photo showing three people time against the other the restaurant , entitled " Est-ce that you accepteriez it ? ' . 
" Boeing proposes of extortion long-courriers in seats closer than in the planes regional turbopropulseurs , " said John Leahy , director of trade Airbus . 
Comme dietary change , people grossissent , but the seats in airplanes have not fundamentally changed . 
Entre the early 1970 's , when the jumbo 747 of Boeing defined the trip long-courrier modern , and the members of the century , the weight of the Américain way of 40 to 49 years has increased about 10 % , according to the data of the us department of the Santé . 
Le round of size of the Américain way of XXIe century is 39,7 pouces , according to the american public health statistics . 
Airbus declares that his rival clings to a concept of a seat dating from the 1950 's , when the circonférence apparatus of the newly called " denounced both set " was narrower . 
Airbus adds that it has commanded a study , which indicates that an additional could at the level of the largeur seats so improve the quality of sleep of 53 % . 
government Boeing the numbers of Airbus regarding the largeur seats and asserts that this is not the boat decide how the airline équilibrent the price of money and equipment . 
Il also said that the study shows that the experience in cabin does not depend on only of the largeur seats . 
" Il is truly to bring nimbleness to airlines and them to do what they think duty to do to carry out their activities , " said Kent Craver , care of the satisfaction passengers among Boeing . 
Elles don 't want to that their saying that would be cost-effective . 
the firm Elles know better than anyone . 
Pour passengers , it is more have some freedom of movement , but for suppliers , it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results . 
the dispute Derrière hiding today a race to commandes airplanes for an estimated amount of at least $ 700 Md at market prices in the coming decades , enough to the us exports , us and europe . 
Comme Reuters has indicated for the first time in july , the configuration of seats is exactly what is fueling the battle between the just last equipment . 
Airbus and Boeing claim every two yield a by seat in their final models of bimoteurs long-courriers 20 % higher than in the market leader in this segment , the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats . 
Les announced performance by Boeing depend in part of the contrast between the 777X configuré with 10 seats by islam , and a model 777 of origin configuré in rangées of 9 . 
Le reward in terms of costs unitaires is weak , compared to the apparatus configuré with 10 seats by islam in the service . 
" Boeing made it for power caser more seats and make aircraft more competitive by reports in our products , " said Kevin Keniston , director of Confort Passager among the european avionneur Airbus . 
D' the other hand , analysts argue that the cabins configurées with 10 seats by islam in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers support of a configuration densest , who can go hand in hand with tariff less expensive . 
" Une largeur of seat of 18 pouces would be perfect for passengers , but the reality is that , from the standpoint trade , the proposal to Airbus was driven by the threat of 777 , " said the simply in domestic of cabins Mary Kirby , and rédactrice founding chief of Runway Girl Network . 
Airbus and Boeing does not provide seats , but offer a catalogue of suppliers -- including the airline must choose . 
Les vendeurs of planes that are the round of the world are even with them a mètre to verify the rival configurations . 
Tout in ventant to offer comfortable equipment , all the boat offer also airplanes with configurations to strong stocking density in the airline low-cost and to travel regional . 
Airbus offers a A350 configuré with 10 seats by brought under but indicates that it has yet to sold . 
Jusqu' to recently , Airbus outlined the need for greater one of the cabins by offering seats broader side go on some of its aircraft . 
Sans the support of the only other major constructeur great equipment , modern experts argue that it is unlikely that his call for industry aéronautique to establish a standard for seats aboutisse , but that it could be remembered the wave of sales of 777X .
