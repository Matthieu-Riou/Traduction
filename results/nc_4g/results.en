Le conflict has focused on the largeur of the seats provided on the stealing long-courriers to passengers of economic – that are not always the most courtisés by the airline , but that the space alloué is essential to increase the efficiency gains in the final equipment entertained by Airbus SAS Boeing and Co . 
Cette week , Airbus called the industry aéronautique to establish a standard imposing a size of seat of at least 18 pouces ( 45,72 cm rise ) in the economic , but his great american rival Boeing argues that it should be to airlines to decide . 
Le différend erupted , while the avionneurs seek to sell of versions even more great of their had long-courriers bimoteurs , hoping eventually a record of commandes during the évènement that will take place of the 21 november . 
La way seats will be willing to the back of the plane – in particular , aura-t-il 9 , or 10 seats in front – is essential for the returns of economic segment of the " mini-jumbo . " 
Boeing argues that its " 777X " reconfigured will welcome in economic class 406 people in of more than 17 pouces of large , and will be configuré with ten seats by islam . 
Airbus indicates that the woodstock competing its A350 secure in class economic grow people in of 18 pouces of broad configurés in rangées of 9 . 
Les giants of the aéronautique échangent often on technical issues in making the advertising in the press professional . 
Aujourd' , Airbus require directly to the public before the salon aéronautique of Dubaï , where the 777X should take precedence over competitors with more than 100 commandes . 
On could realize recently of what might be the beginning of a new air war with the appearance of the financial ’ a photo showing people time against the other the restaurant , called " Est-ce that you accepteriez it ? " 
" Boeing proposes of stealing long-courriers in of the seats closer than in the planes turbopropulseurs regional , " said John Leahy , director of Airbus trade . 
Comme dietary change , people grossissent , but the seats in airplanes have not fundamentally changed . 
Entre the early 1970 's , when the jumbo 747 of Boeing has defined the trip long-courrier modern , and the members of the century , the weight of the Américain c02- 40 to 49 years has increased by 10 % , according to the data department american the Santé . 
Le round of size of the Américain c02- of XXIe century is 39,7 pouces , according to the statistics health american . 
Airbus argues that his rival clings to the concept of a seat dating from the 1950 's , when the circonférence the courts newly called " denounced both set " was narrower . 
Airbus adds that it has commanded a review , which indicates that an additional could at the level of the largeur of the seats so improve the quality of sleep of 53 % . 
Boeing government the numbers of Airbus regarding the largeur of the seats , and says that it is not the boat decide how the airline équilibrent the price of money and equipment . 
Il said that the study shows that the experience in cabin fdi not only of the largeur seats . 
" Il is truly to bring the flexibility to airlines and them to do what they think duty to carry out their activities , " said Kent Craver , welfare of the people in Boeing satisfaction . 
Elles do not want to that their saying that would be cost-effective . 
Elles company is better than anyone . 
Pour aboard , it is more have some freedom of movement , but to suppliers , it is increasingly a question that could affect their results . 
Derrière of the dispute is dr-cafta a race to the commandes of had to a rising said of at least $ 700 Md at the price of the market in the coming decades , enough to the balance of exports and american european . 
Comme Reuters has indicated for the first time in july , the configuration of the seats is exactly what is fueling the battle between the musharraf-bhutto last equipment . 
Airbus and Boeing claim all the two yield a by seat in their final models of bimoteurs long-courriers 20 % higher than in the market leader in this segment , the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats . 
Les performance announced by Boeing depend in part of the contrast between the 777X configuré with ten seats by islam and a model 777 of bayrou configuré in rangées of 9 . 
Le gain in terms of costs unitaires is low compared to the courts configuré with ten seats by islam in the service . 
" Boeing made it for power caser more seats , and make aircraft more competitive by means to our products , " said Kevin Keniston , director of Confort Passager among the avionneur european Airbus . 
D' the other hand , analysts argue that the cabins configurées with ten seats by islam in the existing 777 suggest that many people support of a arrangement densest , who can go hand in hand with in less expensive . 
" Une largeur of seat of 18 pouces would be perfect for passengers , but the reality is that , in trade , the proposal of Airbus was driven by the threat of 777 , " said the simply in domestic of cabins Mary Kirby , founding and rédactrice 's chief Runway Girl Network . 
Airbus and Boeing does not provide seats , but a catalogue of suppliers -- including the airline must choose . 
Les vendeurs of airplanes , which are the round of the world are even with them a mètre to verify the configurations rival . 
Tout in ventant to provide the comfortable , all the boat offer also had with strong configurations to higher to airlines low-cost and to travel , regional . 
Airbus offers a A350 configuré with ten seats by islam but indicates that it has not yet sold . 
Jusqu' to recently , Airbus outlined the need for greater one of the cabins by offering of the seats broader americans go on some of its aircraft . 
Sans the support of the only other major constructeur great equipment modern experts argue that it is unlikely that his call to the industry aéronautique to establish a standard for the seats aboutisse , but that he could be remembered the wave of sales of 777X .
